in
an

Péter-Dániel
Szántó
(personal
communication)
surmises
that
the
colophon
to
this
brief
text
is
written
in
old
Newar
and
amounts
to
saying
that
the
\emph
{vidhi}
was
extracted
from
a
\emph
{ṭippanī}
on
the
\emph
{Saṃvarodayatantra}.
Here
the
manuscript
reads:
\emph
{parahitaparikalpaṃ
dharmmakāyajam
āhu}
|
\emph
{nirupamasukhapātraṃ
cāru

\par
Prof.\
Isaacson
(personal
communication)
has
also
read
the
verse
in
manuscripts
of
the
\emph
{Yogāmbaratantra}
and
the
(proto-)\emph
{Kalparājatantra},
both
Nepalese
compilations.
The
NGMPP
online
catalogue
offers
a
transcription
of
the
verses
in
ms
A
142-12,
a
witness
of
the
\emph
{Yogāmbaratantra}.
According
to
this
transcription,
the
verse
also
reads
\emph
{°pātraṃ}
for
\emph
{°mātraṃ},
\emph
{nirmāṇakāya}
for
\emph
{nirmāṇakāyaṃ},
and
\emph
{sa
bhavatu
bhagavān}
for
\emph
{bhavatu
sa
bhagavān}.
It
would
appear
that
the
verse
achieve
some
popularity
in
Nepal.
\par
The
reading
\emph
{pātra}
can
probably
be
given
the
Tibetan
evidence,
but
the
variant
is
an
interesting
one.
The
readings
\emph
{sa
bhavatu}
and
\emph
{bhavatu
sa}
are
effectively
indistinguishable.
One
may
wish
to
read
\emph
{nirmāṇakāyaḥ}
in
the
third
\emph
{pāda},
in
which
case
the
meaning
is
not
that
Vajrasattva
is
taught
to
be
the
\emph
{nirmāṇakāya},
but
that
he
simply
\emph
{has}
the
\emph
{nirmāṇakāya}.
Some
further
research
into
Advayavajra's
position
on
the
three
\emph
{kāya}s
may
reveal
which
of
these
understandings
is
more
appropriate.
On
the
reading
\emph
{nirmāṇakāyaḥ},
the
relatively
pronoun
\emph
{yasya}
is,
at
least
according
to
my
perception,
slightly
smoother.
\par
It
may
be
worth
comparing
the
two
above
Tibetan
translations
of
this
verse
with
Ye
shes
'byung
gnas's
effort
here
for
the
NaiPra:
\emph

The
translation
\emph
{rgyur
gyur}
for
\emph
{vidhānāt}
is
difficult
to
account
for;
it
also
appears
to
be
an
adjective
qualifying
either
\emph
{gang}
or
\emph
{sprul
pa'i
sku}
rather
than
an
ablative
form
(here
it
is
perhaps
Marpa's
translation
that
has
the
clearest
rendering
with
\emph
{mdzas
pa
las}).
Similarly,
the
syntax
of
the
final
line,
with
\emph
{rdo
rje
sems
dpa'}
separated
from
the
pronoun
\emph
{de},
is
considerably
more
opaque
than
the
other
two
translations.
\par
Although
it
may
be
entirely
coincidental,
it
is
nonetheless
noteworthy
that
the
opening
verse
of
Ratnākaraśānti's
\emph
{Bhramaharasādhana}
is
also
in
Mālinī
metre.

I
offer
this
conjectural
reading
based
on
\TIB
\
as
well
as
similar
formulations
in
two
other
\emph
{sādhana}s
by
Advayavajra.
First,
the
\emph
{Saptākṣarasādhana}
reads:
\emph
{\ldots
\
yathāvidhinā
pūjayet
vandayet
|
tatas
teṣāṃ
purataḥ
pāpadeśanāpāpākaraṇasaṃvaraṃ

ātmabhāvaniryyātanā\dsh
adhyeṣaṇāyācanāś
ca
kṛtvā
\ldots
}
(ed.\
p.\
460).
In
the
NaiPra,
the
Tibetan
translation
indicates
the
inclusion
of
\emph
{puṇyapariṇāmanā},
but
the
word
\emph
{yācanā}
is
reflected
neither
in
the
Tibetan
nor
in
the
Sanskrit
manuscript,
which
has
resumed
at
the
place
where
one
would
expect
to
see
it.
Otherwise
the
two
texts
are
evidently
closely
parallel.
\par
Advayavajra's
\emph
{Vajravārāhīsādhana}
reads
as
follows:
\emph
{tadagrataḥ
pāpadeśanāpāpākaraṇasaṃvarapuṇyānumodanāpuṇyapariṇāmanātriśaraṇagamanabodhicittotpādādikaṃ
kṛtvā}
\ldots
\
(ed-f
p.\
59;
ed-b
p.\
424)
(\emph
{°pāpākaraṇasaṃvara°}]
ed-f;
\emph
{deest}
in
ed-b
but
recorded
as
a
variant).
Here
\emph
{vandana}
is
not
present,
and
\emph
{ātmaniryātana}
and
so
forth
have
probably
been
replaced
with
the
word
\emph
{ādika}.
In
the
NaiPra,
the
\emph
{ca}
before
\emph
{kṛtvā}
indicates
that
more
than
one
word
precedes,
as
in
\emph
{Saptākṣarasādhana}.
I
assume
\emph
{pāpadeśanāpāpākaraṇasaṃvaraṃ}
can
be
understood
as
a
\emph
{samāhāradvandva},
but
can
find
no
other
attestation
of
the
compound,
and
it
is
not
immediately
clear
to
me
why
these
actions
should
be
divided
in
the
way
they
are.
On
the
various
preliminary
stages
in
similar
\emph
{sādhana}s,
see
\textcite
[122–124]{english2002}.
\par
As
for
the
first
sentence
(\emph
{atra
ca
prajñopāyayoḥ}
etc.),
I
can
find
no
parallel
in
others
\emph
{sādhana}s,
so
I
only
rely
on
\TIB
\
for
the
proposed
conjecture.
If
I
have
understood
the
Tibetan
correctly,
I
believe
Advayavajra
is
offering
a
justification
for
worshipping
the
eight-faced
Heruka,
i.e.\
Picuvajra,
at
the
beginning
of
the
\emph
{sādhana}:
to
put
it
somewhat
baldly,
a
\emph
{sādhana}
that
includes
worship
(and
meditation
on)
both
male
and
female
deities
serves
to
help
one
realise
insight
and
means
as
having
an
identical
nature.

as

with
\emph
{jñāna}
or
with
\emph

The

interpretation
is
offered
by,

example,
Śākyarakṣita

indicating
that,
perhaps,
these
words
were
not
understood
as
part
of
the
mantra:
\emph

Indeed
the
mantra
\emph
{oṁ

does
generally
stand
on
its
own;
however,
it
would
appear
that
Advayavajra
is
fond
of
this
reformulation
of
the
mantra,
which
emphasizes
the
emptiness
of
all
phenomena
(see
\cite
[128]{english2002}).
\par
Evidence
to
support
this
can
be
found
in
other
\emph
{sādhana}s
composed
by
Advayavajra,
such
as
the
\emph
{Saptākṣarasādhana}:
\emph
{tataḥ

}
(ed.\
p.\
460).
Note,
however,
that
Mar

Chos

dbang
phyug's
Tibetan
translation
of
the
\emph
{Saptākṣarasādhana}
does
not
reflect
the

and
appears
to
have
attempted
to
interpret
the

as
a
stand-alone
clause:
\emph

be

\par
Advayavajra's
\emph

also
has
a
formulation
resembling
the

\par
We
also
find
a
rendering

Leaving
aside
other
slight
differences
for
the
moment,
we
can
see
that
the
translator
(whose
identity
is
unknown
to
me)
appears
to
have
treated
the
words
in
question
with
an
approach
similar
to
that
of
Mar

\par
Finally,
the
extended
mantra
is
also
found
in
some
recensions
of
the
\emph
{Vajravārāhīsādhana}.
Finot's
edition
reads:
\emph
{tataḥ,

(perhaps
\emph
{vajra}
is
missing
from
the
first
\emph
{śūnyatājñāna°}).
Bhattacharyya's
edition
in
the
\emph
{Sādhanamālā}
omits
the
first
half
of
the
mantra,
as
does
the
translation
by

\par
Taken
altogether,
this
evidence
affirms
that
Advayavajra
had
a
special
preference
for
an
`enhanced'
formulation
of
the
popular
mantra,
which
may
have
caused
some
confusion
for
Tibetan
translators.
In
view
of
this
preference,
it
may
also
be
worth
noting
that
the
formulation,
as
well
as
other
key
terms
associated
with
Advayavajra's
philosophy
such
as
\emph
{apratiśṭhita},
is
wholly
absent
from
the
relevant
portion
of
the
\emph
{Hevajrākhya},
which
is
a
factor
to
consider
when
evaluating
the

authorial
attribution:
\emph

\par
One
lingering
doubt
is
that
the
four
other
attestations
of
the
mantra
appear
to
put
\emph
{sarvadharmāḥ}
first
and
\emph
{aham}
second,
whereas
the
NaiPra
does
the
opposite.
Given
that
\TIB
\
and
the
Sanskrit
witness
both
support
this
seemingly
reversed
order
in
the
NaiPra,
I
do
not
emend
the
text;
however,
there
is
some
doubt
as
to
whether
it
is
correct.

these

`[made

Since
the

I
regard
this

offers

If

I

unambiguously
locative.

According
to
some
other
accounts

there

a

in

east
(see
\cite
[vol.\

\cite
[140]{english2002}).
Like
the
NaiPra,
however,
the
anonymous
\emph
{Aṣṭaśmaśāna}
places
a
\emph
{harītakīvṛkṣa}
in
the
east.
The
Pandanus
Database
of

identifies
\emph
{śirīṣa}
as
\emph
{Acacia

(Siris
tree)
and
\emph
{harītakī}
as
\emph
{Terminalia

Retz.}
(Chebulic

It
is
unclear
to
me

Advayavajra
regarded

has
suffered
from
another

skip.
The
neuter
form
\emph

lends
support
to
what
can
be
understood
from
\TIB
:
namely,
that
there
should
be
a
second
sentence
regarding
the
colour
of
\emph
{caitya}s.
The

sentence,
which
in
\TIB
\
reads
\emph
{de

skyong
brgyad
kyi
kha
dog
ni
grags
par
zad

is
relatively
unproblematic.
Here
I
have
`back
translated'
\emph
{grags

zad
do}
with
\emph
{prasiddha}—attestations
for
this
correspondence
cannot

found

the

of

Ye
shes
'byung
gnas,

we
do
find
it
elsewhere,
such
as
in

of
Ratnākaraśānti's
MuĀ
ad
HeTa
2.4.53
(ed.\
p.\
183;
D
f.\
186r).
\par
The
second
sentence
is
slightly
more
problematic.
\TIB
's
reading—\emph
{mchod
rten
brgyad
kyi
kha
dog
kyang
rtogs
par
bya'o}—suggests
something
along
the
lines
of,
\emph
{aṣṭacaityānāṃ
varṇā
api
boddhavyāḥ}.
Our
Sanskrit
manuscript,
on
the
other
hand,
indicates
that
the
sentence
ends
with
\emph
{pakṣavarṇāni
boddhavyāni}.
I
suspect,
therefore,
that,
for
one
reason
or
another,
words
are
missing
from
the
Tibetan
translation,
which
is
indeed
very
terse.
Perhaps
it
could
have
read:
\emph
{mchod
rten
brgyad
kyi
kha
dog
kyang
de
dang
mthun
par
rtogs
par
bya'o/
/}.
In
any
case,
the
compound
\emph
{sapakṣavarṇa}
is,
as
far
as
I
can
tell,
unattested
elsewhere,
so
perhaps
it
is
not
the
best
conjecture;
nevertheless,
because
it
does
seem
to
make
good
sense
in
the
context,
and
because
it
requires
minimal

I
provisionally

Given

In

is
the

translations
of
the

(D
f.\

and
the
NaiPra:
\emph
{rnam
par
snang
mdzad

The
reading
is
also
found
in
the
\emph
{Saṃpuṭatantra}
(5.4.33d)
and
in
the
\emph
{Vajrāvalī}
(p.\
452),
as
well
as
in
Ḍobīheruka's
{Amṛtaprabhā}
as
found
in
Bhattacharyya's
edition
of
the
\emph
{Sādhanamālā}
(p.\
447).
Witnesses
of
Saroruhavajra's
\emph
{Sādhanopāyikā},
including
its
Tibetan
translations,
and
of
Bhadrapāda's
\emph
{Dveṣavajrasādhana}
support
\emph
{sthitaḥ}.
I
tentatively
propose
that
the
reading
\emph
{sthitaḥ}
should
be
maintained
in
the
NaiPra,
despite
its
Tibetan
translation,
which
here
appears
to
have
been
influenced
by
'Brog
mi's
translation
of
the
root
tantra.
However,
the
two
witnesses
of
the
\emph
{Ācāryakriyāsamuccaya}
that
I
have
consulted
also
support
reading
\emph
{smṛtaḥ}.
\par
The
word
\emph
{tathā}
in
2b
is
supported
by
\TIB
:
\emph
{lus
kun
rdo
rje
'dzin
bzhin
no}.
For
the
parallels,
Gerloff's
edition
of
the
\emph
{Sādhanopāyikā}
reads
\emph
{vaset},
which
is
reported
to
be
found
in
one
paper
witness,
while
\emph
{paśyet},
unmetrical
and
ungrammatical,
is
the
reading
of
the
\emph
{Hevajrasādhanasaṅgraha}
codex
for
both
the
\emph
{Sādhanopāyikā}
and
the
\emph
{Dveṣavajrasādhana}.
The
canonical
Tibetan
translation
of
the
\emph
{Sādhanopāyikā}
reads
\emph
{yan
lag
kun
spyod
rdo
rje
'dzin}
(\cite
[vol.\
1
135]{gerloff2020}),
while
a
para-canonical
translation
reads
\emph
{yan
lag
kun
la
rdor
'dzin
dgod}
(\cite
[vol.\
2
152]{gerloff2020})
(no
Tibetan
translation
of
the
\emph
{Dveṣavajrasādhana}
has
been
identified).
The
latter
reading
is
probably
corresponds
to
what
is
found
in
the
\emph
{Ācāryakriyāsamuccaya},
which
reads
\emph
{sarvāṅgeṣu
vajradhṛk
nyaset}
(also
grammatically
anomalous).
In
sum,
I
think
it
is
difficult
to
regard
any
of
the
possible
readings
for
the
final
word
of
2b
as
particularly
secure.

In
2d
(=
HeTa
2.6.3b),
we
find
\emph
{śirasi}
in
Sanskrit
and
Tibetan
of
the
NaiPra,
but
here
there
no
evidence
for
it
in
the
HeTa.
The
word
\emph
{dhṛtā}
is
reflected
in
\TIB
,
as
in
the
HeTa.
A
very
hypermetrical
reading
for
the
\emph
{pāda},
such
as
\emph
{namanāya
śirasi
cakrikā
dhṛtā},
is
not
implausible
for
the
language
of
the
tantra,
but
I
am
hesitant
to
adopt
it
for
the
\emph
{sādhana}
unless
stronger
evidence
becomes
available.
\par
In
2d
(=
HeTa
2.6.3b),
we
find
\emph
{namanāya}
instead
of
the
tantra's
\emph
{namanārthaṃ},
and
similarly,
instead
of
\emph
{mantraṃ
japtuṃ}
found
in
HeTa
2.6.4b,
the
NaiPra
appears
to
read
\emph
{mantrajāpāya}.
The
NaiPra's
readings
are
equivalent
to
those
of
the
tantra
metrically
and
in
terms
of
sense.
\par
In
3a
(=
HeTa
2.6.3d),
it
is
interesting
to
note
that,
like
the
NaiPra's
Sanskrit
manuscript,
one
witness
of
the
HeTa
also
reads
\emph
{°āśramaṇāya},
although
the
reading
does
not
make
very
good
sense
and
should
probably
be
rejected.
\par
In
3c,
it
appears
that
Advayavajra
may
have
replaced
the
tantra's
\emph
{śravaṇayoḥ}
with
\emph
{karṇayoḥ},
which
is
metrically
smoother.
\par
The
\emph
{pāda}s
4a
and
b
evidently
reverse
HeTa
2.6.4c
and
d,
and
this
is
also
reflected
in
\TIB
.
The
metre
is
rough
in
4b
but
probably
passable
if
\emph
{rucakaḥ}
is
pronounced
with
the
right
emphasis.
Finally,
while
the
tantra's
manuscripts
point
towards
reading
\emph
{mudrā}
(probably
to
be
understood
as
\emph
{mudrāḥ},
accusative
plural),
it
seems
equally
possible
that
Advayavajra
wrote
\emph
{mudrām},
as
the
NaiPra's
ms
indicates.

[374]{mathes2014}[132]{mathes2021},
in
advancing
his
thesis
that
Advayavajra
advocates
a
non-tantric
form
of
Mahāmudrā
practice,
has
written
the
following
about
this
passage:
`...
it
is
not
completely
out
of
the
question
that
an
empowerment
in
Maitrīpa's
system
could
start
directly
with
the
\emph
{prajñājñāna}-empowerment.
In
his
\emph
{Nairātmyāprakāśa},
Maitrīpa
thus
explains
the
ordinary
creation
stage
as
an
optional
practice,
and
not
as
a
necessary
requirement
for
the
subsequent
stages.'
Judging
by
Mathes's
translation,
his
assertion
rests
on
having
understood
the
word
\emph
{anyatra}
in
the
sense
of
`alternatively'—perhaps
as
an
equivilent
to
\emph
{athavā}.
I
am
unsure
why
we
should
understand
\emph
{anyatra}
here
as
having
a
meaning
other
than
the
expected
`elsewhere'.
The
meaning
`elsewhere'
makes
good
sense
in
the
larger
context
of
the
\emph
{Nairātmyāprakāśa}:
the
\emph
{utpattikrama}
taught
here
in
this
\emph
{sādhana}
consists
in
visualising
the
goddesses;
elsewhere,
a
\emph
{gambhīrotpattikrama}
and
forms
of
\emph
{utpannakrama}
are
also
taught,
and
they
too
are
connected
with
Nairātmyā.
\par
Even
were
we
to
grant
that
Advayavajra
intends
\emph
{anyatra}
to
mean
`alternatively',
this
still
does
not
support
Mathes's
interpretation
that
`the
ordinary
creation
stage'
is
an
optional
practice.
This
would
simply
mean
that
practitioners
can
choose
which
practice
to
do—for
instance,
they
may
practice
\emph
{bāhyotpattikrama}
on
Mondays
and
\emph
{gambhīrotpattikrama}
on
Tuesdays;
but
that
does
not
tell
us
whether
or
not
\emph
{bāhyotpattikrama}
is
a
necessary
prerequisite
for
the
subsequent
stages,
much
less
about
the
kind
initiation
required
to
engage
in
these
practices.
There
may
be
evidence
elsewhere
in
Advayavajra's
corpus
that
addresses
this
question,
which
is
indeed
a
very
interesting
one,
but
here
the
matter
is
simply
not
addressed.

basis
of

6.39
(also

as

Perhaps
\emph
{bāla}
is
to
be
understood
in
the
sense
of
a
child,
and
something
akin
to
this
understanding
is
reflected
in
the
\emph

translation,
which
renders
\emph
{bālasiṃhāṇa}
as
\emph
{byi

(D

302r).
It
also
seems
possible
to
understand
\emph
{bāla}
(or
\emph
{vāla})
in
the
sense
of
hair.
The
MuĀ's
Tibetan
translation,
however,
renders
the
compound
in
question
as
\emph
{kha
chu
dang
snabs}
(D
f.\
232r),
which
suggests
reading
\emph
{lālāsiṃhāṇa}.
This
reading
is
attractive
and
a
common
combination
in
Sanskrit,
but
I
not
seen
support
for
it
in
Sanskrit
witnesses
of
the
passages
in
question.
The
NaiPra's
Tibetan
translation
reads
\emph
{stobs
dang
snabs},
and
the
Tibetan
translation
of
the
\emph
{Saṃpuṭatantra}
reads
\emph
{sha

both
of
which
could
suggest
reading
\emph

I
have

this.
The

First,
syntactically
\TIB

understands
two
sentences
where
I
understand
only
one.
\TIB
\
has
perhaps
confused
\emph
{karaṇa}
with
\emph
{kāraṇa}.
It
also
reflects
the
word
\emph
{advaya},
not
found
in
the
Sanskrit
manuscript,
within
the
compound
ending
\emph
{vāhin},
and
it
connects
this
compound
with
the
following
word,
thus
qualifying
\emph
{bodhicitta}.
These
last
two
points
are
valid
possibilities,
and
of
them
I
wish
to
accept
the
former.
We
find
a
few
parallels
in
Advayavajra's
corpus
for
the
compound
\emph
{yuganaddhādvayavāhin}:
e.g.,
in
the
\emph
{Amanasikārādhāra}
(ed.\
p.\
497),
the
\emph
{Sekatātparyasaṅgraha}
(ed.\
p.\
413),
and
the
\emph
{Pañcatathāgatamudrāvivaraṇa}
(ed.\
p.\
377).
In
the
\emph
{Sekatātparyasaṅgraha},
however,
we
also
find
\emph
{yuganaddhavāhin},
as
part
of
the
compound
\emph
{asaṃkṛtābhedayuganaddhavāhibodhasamaya}.
In
general,
however,
it
would

Whether

should
qualify
\emph

slightly
more
difficult
to
determine,

perhaps
ultimately
there
is
no
great
difference.
\emph
{Bodhicitta},
the

nature

mind,
is
\emph
{anābhogayuganaddhādvayavāhin}
in
that
it
supports
(\emph
{vāhin}
in
the
sense
of
`bearing')
the
non-dual
state
of
the
effortless
coalescence
of
bliss/compassion
and
emptiness;
manifesting
\emph
{bodhicitta}
is
\emph
{anābhogayuganaddhavāhin}
in
that
it
produces/leads
to
(\emph
{vāhin}
in
the

\emph
{pra-√sū}

the

\begin
{english}I
have
hesitantly
settled
on
this
conjecture
with
some
inspiration
from
\TIB
:
\emph
{gsang
sngags
tshul
gyi
bstan

/bla

dam
pa'i
'bad

las

We
might
expect
\emph
{mantranaya}
for
\emph
{gsang
sngags
thsul},
but
that
would
be
metrically
bad;
a
genitive
case
ending
would
also
be
impossible,
but
perhaps
we
could
also
conjecture
the
compound
\emph
{mantrayānaśāstrasāraṃ}.
My
solution
has
the
slight
disadvantage
of
forming
a
\emph
{ra-vipulā}
in
the
\emph
{pāda},
which
is
unexpected
but
not
impossible,
and
we
can't
easily
explain
the
formation
of
the
corrupt
manuscript
reading:
\emph
{cakranayā
śāstrasāraṃ
raṃ}.
Note
that
\TIB
\
has
also
interpreted
\emph
{guroḥ}
as
a
genitive
form
connected
to
\emph
{yatnena},
leading
a
bizarre
meaning:
`Having
understood
the
essence
of
the
\emph
{śāstra}s
of
the
Way
of
Mantra
by
means
of
[my]
Guru's
effort'.
I
interpret
the
text
as
I
have
construed
it
as
follows:
`Having
diligently
understood
from
[my]
guru
the
essence
of
\emph
{śāstra}
in
the
Vehicle
of
Mantra
\ldots
'

The
