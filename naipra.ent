Péter-Dániel
Szántó
(personal
communication)
surmises
that
the
colophon
to
this
brief
text
is
written
in
old
Newar
and
amounts
to
saying
that
the
\emph
{vidhi}
was
extracted
from
a
\emph
{ṭippanī}
on
the
\emph
{Saṃvarodayatantra}.
The
only
noteworthy
variant
reading
here
is
`\emph
{sa
bhavatu
bhagavān}'
in
place
of
`\emph
{bhavatu
sa
bhagavān}',
both
of
which
are
equally
plausible.
\par
It
may
be
worth
comparing
the
two
above
Tibetan
translations
of
this
verse
with
Ye
shes
'byung
gnas's
effort
here
for
the
NaiPra:
\emph

The
translation
\emph
{rgyur
gyur}
for
\emph
{vidhānāt}
is
difficult
to
account
for;
it
also
appears
to
be
an
adjective
qualifying
either
\emph
{gang}
or
\emph
{sprul
pa'i
sku}
rather
than
an
ablative
form
(here
it
is
perhaps
Marpa's
translation
that
has
the
clearest
rendering
with
`\emph
{mdzas
pa

Similarly,
the
syntax
of
the
final
line,
with
\emph
{rdo

separated
from
the
pronoun
\emph
{de},
is
considerably
more
opaque
than
the
other
two

\par
Although
it
may
be
entirely
coincidental,
it
is
nonetheless
noteworthy
that
the
opening
verse
of
Ratnākaraśānti's

is
also
in
Mālinī

Here
the
transmitted
text
has
suffered
from
what
was
likely
a
scribe's
eyeskip.
I
offer
this
conjectural
reading
based
on
\TIB
\
as
well
as
similar
formulations
in
two
other
\emph
{sādhana}s
by
Advayavajra.
First,
the
\emph
{Saptākṣarasādhana}
reads:
\emph
{\ldots
\
yathāvidhinā
pūjayet
vandayet
|
tatas
teṣāṃ
purataḥ
pāpadeśanāpāpākaraṇasaṃvaraṃ

ātmabhāvaniryyātanā\dsh
adhyeṣaṇāyācanāś
ca
kṛtvā
\ldots
}
(ed.\
p.\
460).
In
the
NaiPra,
the
Tibetan
translation
indicates
the
inclusion
of
\emph
{puṇyapariṇāmanā},
but
the
word
\emph
{yācanā}
is
reflected
neither
in
the
Tibetan
nor
in
the
Sanskrit
manuscript,
which
has
resumed
at
the
place
where
one
would
expect
to
see
it.
Otherwise
the
two
texts
are
evidently
closely
parallel.
Advayavajra's
\emph
{Vajravārāhīsādhana}
reads
as
follows:
\emph
{\begin
{sanskrit}tadagrataḥ
pāpadeśanāpāpākaraṇasaṃvarapuṇyānumodanāpuṇyapariṇāmanātriśaraṇagamanabodhicittotpādādikaṃ
kṛtvā\end
{sanskrit}}
\ldots
\
(ed-f
p.\
59;
ed-b
p.\
424)
(\emph
{°pāpākaraṇasaṃvara°}]
ed-f;
\emph
{deest}
in
ed-b
but
recorded
as
a
variant).
Here
\emph
{vandana}
is
not
present,
and
\emph
{ātmaniryātana}
and
so
forth
have
probably
been
replaced
with
the
word
\emph
{ādika}.
In
the
NaiPra,
the
\emph
{ca}
before
\emph
{kṛtvā}
indicates
that
more
than
one
word
precedes,
as
in
\emph
{Saptākṣarasādhana}.
I
assume
\emph
{pāpadeśanāpāpākaraṇasaṃvaraṃ}
can
be
understood
as
a
\emph
{samāhāradvandva},
but
can
find
no
other
attestation
of
the
compound,
and
it
is
not
immediately
clear
to
me
why
these
actions
should
be
divided
in
the
way
they
are.
On
the
various
preliminary
stages
in
similar
\emph
{sādhana}s,
see
\textcite
[122–124]{english2002}.
\par
As
for
the
first
sentence
(\emph
{atra
ca
prajñopāyayoḥ}
etc.),
I
can
find
no
parallel
in
others
\emph
{sādhana}s,
so
I
only
rely
on
\TIB
\
for
the
proposed
conjecture.
If
I
have
understood
the
Tibetan
correctly,
I
believe
Advayavajra
is
offering
a
justification
for
worshipping
the
eight-faced
Heruka,
i.e.\
Picuvajra,
at
the
beginning
of
the
\emph
{sādhana}:
to
put
it
somewhat
baldly,
a
\emph
{sādhana}
that
includes
worship
(and
meditation
on)
both
male
and
female
deities
serves
to
help
one
realise
insight
and
means
as
having
an
identical
nature.

\begin
{english}On
the
compound
\emph
{śūnyatājñānavajrasvabhāvātmaka},
traditional
authorities
have
interpreted
\emph
{vajra}
either
as
co-referential
with
\emph
{jñāna}
or
with
\emph
{svabhāva}.
The
former
interpretation
is
offered
by,
for
example,
Śākyarakṣita
in
his
\emph
{Abhisamayamañjarī},
and
the
latter
by
Abhayākaragupta
in

of

{śūnyatājñānavajrasvabhāvātmakāḥ

in

indicating
that,
perhaps,
these
words
were
not
understood
as
part
of
the
mantra:
\emph
{dngos

Indeed
the
mantra
\emph
{oṁ

'ham}
does
generally
stand
on
its
own;
however,
it
would
appear
that
Advayavajra
is
fond
of
this
reformulation
of
the
mantra,
which
emphasizes
the
emptiness
of
all
phenomena
(see
\cite
[128]{english2002}).
\par
Evidence
to
support
this
can
be
found
in
other
\emph
{sādhana}s
composed
by
Advayavajra,
such
as
the
\emph
{Saptākṣarasādhana}:
\emph
{tataḥ

}
(ed.\
p.\
460).
Note,
however,
that
Mar
pa
Chos

dbang
phyug's
Tibetan
translation
of
the
\emph
{Saptākṣarasādhana}
does
not
reflect
the
first
\emph
{oṁ}
and
appears
to
have
attempted
to
interpret
the
words
as
a
stand-alone
clause:
\emph

(\emph
{de

may
be
a
corruption
of
\emph
{don}
or
\emph
{don

\par
Advayavajra's
\emph
{Hevajraviśuddhinidhi}
also
has
a
formulation
resembling
the
\emph
{Saptākṣarasādhana}:
\emph

completely
lacks
any

the

(see

\par
We
also
find
a
rendering
of
more
or
less
the

in
the

of

Leaving
aside
other
slight
differences
for
the
moment,
we
can
see
that
the
translator
(whose
identity
is
unknown
to
me)
appears
to
have
treated
the
words
in
question
with
an
approach
similar
to
that
of
Mar
pa
Chos
kyi
dbang
phyug.
\par
Finally,
the
extended
mantra
is
also
found
in
some
recensions
of
the
\emph
{Vajravārāhīsādhana}.
Finot's
edition
reads:
\emph
{tataḥ,
oṃ

śūnyatājñānavajrasvabhāvātmako

apratiṣṭharūpena

(perhaps
\emph
{vajra}
is
missing
from
the
first
\emph
{śūnyatājñāna°}).
Bhattacharyya's
edition
in
the
\emph
{Sādhanamālā}
omits
the
first
half
of
the
mantra,
as
does
the
translation
by
mTshur
ston
dBang

\par
Taken
altogether,
this
evidence
affirms
that
Advayavajra
had
a
special
preference
for
an
`enhanced'
formulation
of
the
popular
mantra,
which
may
have
caused
some
confusion
for
Tibetan
translators.
In
view
of
this
preference,
it
may
also
be
worth
noting
that
the
formulation,
as
well
as
other
key
terms
associated
with
Advayavajra's
philosophy
such
as
\emph
{apratiśṭhita},
is
wholly
absent
from
the
relevant
portion
of
the
\emph
{Hevajrākhya},
which
is
a
factor
to
consider
when
evaluating
the
text's
authorial
attribution:
\emph
{tataḥ
paṭhed
jinamantrakam—\begin
{mantra}\textnormal
{oṁ

'ham}\end
{mantra}.
tasmin
samaye
svaparaśaradamalanabhasannibhaṃ
paśyet}
(f.\
9r).
\par
One
lingering
doubt
is
that
the
four
other
attestations
of
the
mantra
appear
to
put
\emph
{sarvadharmāḥ}
first
and
\emph
{aham}
second,
whereas
the
NaiPra
does
the
opposite.
Given
that
\TIB
\
and
the
Sanskrit
witness
both
support
this
seemingly
reversed
order
in
the
NaiPra,
I
do
not
emend
the
text;
however,
there
is
some
doubt
as
to
whether
it
is
correct.

One
may
consider
correcting
the

reading
\emph

to
\emph
{aṇusaṃhatair

but
I
do
not

this

The

\emph
{'od

We

that
it

indeed
additional

that
produce
the

and
these
are
described
as
`[made
of]
the
light
rays
of
that
[initial

Since
the
characters
for
\emph
{ṇu}

\emph

be
extremely
similar,
I
regard
this
conjecture
as
relatively

{english}
For
each
of
the
trees
in
the
eight
charnel
grounds,
\TIB
\
treats
the
words
as
if
they
were
nominative
forms.
\MSN
\
offers
two
instances
of
the
words
without
case
endings,
one
instance
with
a
form
that
is
corrupt
in
another
way,
and
five
instances
of
locative
forms.
If
we
were
to
accept
nominative
forms,
a
conjunction
such
as
`\emph
{ca}'
would
also
be
natural;
I
therefore
find
this
possibility
unlikely,
and
adopting
it
would
require
major
alterations
to
the
transmitted
text.
Compounded
forms
such
as
\emph
{harītakīvṛkṣamecakavarṇaḥ}
can,
I
believe,
also
be
discounted,
as
they
appear
unprecedented
and
unnecessary.
If
locative
forms
were
intended,
we
can
account
for
the
error
in
that
it
appears
relatively
easy
for
a
scribe
to
mistake
\emph
{kṣa}
for
\emph
{kṣe};
we
also
see
that
forms
less
susceptible
to
this
confusion
(e.g.\
\emph
{śākhini}
or
\emph
{tarau})
are
here
unambiguously
locative.
\par
According
to
other
accounts
of
the
eight
charnel
grounds,
there
is
a
\emph
{śirīṣa}
in
the
east
(see
\cite
[vol.\
2
739–740]{gerloff2020};
\cite
[140]{english2002}).
The
Pandanus
Database
of
Plants
identifies
\emph
{śirīṣa}
as
\emph
{Acacia
lebbeck
Willd.}
(Siris
tree)
and
\emph
{harītakī}
as
\emph
{Terminalia
chebula
Retz.}
(Chebulic
myrobalan).
It
is
unclear
to
me
whether
or
not
Advayavajra
regarded
the
two
as
synonyms.
The
anonymous
\emph
{Aṣṭaśmaśāna}
also
identifies
a
\emph
{harītakīvṛkṣa}
in
the
east.

specifies
that

has
suffered
from
an
eye
skip.
The
neuter
form
\emph
{°varṇāni}
lends
support
to
what
can
be
understood
from
\TIB
:
namely,
that
there
should
be
a
second
sentence
regarding
the
colour
of
\emph
{caitya}s.
The
first
sentence,
which
in

\
reads
\emph
{de
ltar
phyogs
skyong
brgyad
kyi
kha
dog
ni
grags
par
zad

is
relatively
unproblematic.
Here
I
have
`back
translated'
\emph
{grags
par
zad
do}
with
\emph
{prasiddha}—attestations
for
this
correspondence
cannot
be
found
in
the

of
mTshur
Ye
shes
'byung
gnas,
but
we
do
find
attestations
elsewhere,
such
as
in
'Gos

translation
of
Ratnākaraśānti's
MuĀ
ad
HeTa
2.4.53
(ed.\
p.\

D
f.\
186r).
\par
The
second
sentence
is
slightly
more
problematic.
\TIB
's
reading—\emph
{mchod
rten
brgyad
kyi
kha
dog
kyang
rtogs
par
bya'o}—suggests
something
along
the
lines
of,
\emph
{aṣṭacaityānāṃ
varṇā
api
bodhavyāḥ}.
Our
Sanskrit
manuscript,
on
the
other
hand,
indicates
that
the
sentence
ends
with
\emph
{pakṣavarṇāni
bodhavyāni}.
I
suspect,
therefore,
that,
for
one
reason
or
another,
words
are
missing
from
the
Tibetan
translation,
which
is
indeed
overly
terse.
Perhaps
it
could
have
read:
\emph
{mchod
rten
brgyad
kyi
kha
dog
kyang
de
dang
mthun
par
rtogs
par
bya'o/
/}.
In
any
case,
the
compound
\emph
{sapakṣavarṇa}
is,
as
far
as
I
can
tell,
unattested
elsewhere,
so
perhaps
it
is
not
the
best
conjecture;
nevertheless,
because

seem
to
make
good
sense
in
the
context,
and
because

minimal

(ed.\

Bhadrapāda's

for

(another

it
is
likely
that

In
1d,
\emph
{smṛtaḥ}
is
the
reading
found
in
all
palm-leaf
witnesses
of
the
HeTa
available
to
me,
and
this
is
reflected
in
the
Tibetan
translations
of
the
tantra
(D
f.\
7r)
and
the
NaiPra:
\emph
{rnam
par
snang
mdzad

The
reading
is
also
found
in
the
verses
as
they
appears
in
the
\emph
{Sādhanamālā}
edition
of
Ḍombīheruka's
\emph
{Amṛtaprabhā}
(p.\
447),
\emph
{Saṃpuṭatantra}
5.4.33d,
and
the
\emph
{Vajrāvalī}
(ed.\
p.\

Witnesses
of
both
Saroruhavajra's
\emph
{Sādhanopāyikā}
and
Bahdrapāda's
\emph
{Dveṣavajrasādhana},
however,
all
support
\emph
{sthitaḥ}.
I
therefore
believe
that
the
reading
\emph
{sthitaḥ}
should
be
maintained
in
the
NaiPra,
despite
the
Tibetan
translation,
which
here
appears
to
have
been
influenced
by
'Brog
mi's
translation
of
the
root
tantra.
\par
The
word
\emph
{tathā}
in
2b
is
supported
by
\TIB
:
\emph
{lus
kun
rdo
rje
'dzin
bzhin
no}.
For
the
parallels,
Gerloff's
edition
of
the
\emph
{Sādhanopāyika}
prints
\emph
{vaset},
which
is
reported
to
be
found
in
one
paper
witness,
while
\emph
{paśyet},
unmetrical
and
ungrammatical,
is
the
reading
of
the
\emph
{Hevajrasādhanasaṅgraha}
codex.
The
canonical
Tibetan
translation
here
reportedly
reads
\emph
{yan
lag
kun
spyod
rdo
rje
'dzin}
(\cite
[vol.\
1
135]{gerloff2020}),
while
a
para-canonical
translation
reads
\emph
{yan
lag
kun
la
rdor
'dzin
dgod}
(\cite
[vol.\
2
152]{gerloff2020})—neither,
I
believe,
clearly
favours
any
of
the
available
Sanskrit
readings.
As
reported
by
Gerloff,
the
\emph
{Hevajrasādhanasaṅgraha}
codex
also
reads
\emph
{paśyet}
in
the
\emph
{Dveṣavajrasādhana},
and
this
is
presently
the
text's
sole
witness
(there
is
no
known
Tibetan
translation).
In
sum,
I
think
it
is
difficult
to
regard
any
of
the
possible
readings
for
the
final
word
of
2b
as
particularly
secure.

At
present
I
am
uncertain
why
we
see
these
variations.
One
possibility
is
that
Advayavajra
simply
used
material
from
the
tantra
imprecisely.
Of
the
variations,
\TIB
\
includes
a
reflex
of
\emph
{śirasi}
in
2d
(=
HeTa
2.6.3b),
a
word
that
we
have
no
evidence
for
in
the
HeTa.
It
also
supports
reversing
\emph
{pāda}s
c
and
d
of
HeTa
2.6.4.
\TIB
\
does
not
clearly
offer
support
for
or
against
the
remaning
variants.
Of
these,
the
reading
\emph
{°devatāsya}
for
2c
(=
HeTa
2.6.3a)
found
in
the
NaiPra's
ms
is
an
impossible
form
and
metrically
bad,
and
thus
it
must
be
rejected.
It
is
interesting
that
the
NaiPra's
ms
reading
of
\emph
{aśramaṇāya}
in
3a
(=
HeTa
2.6.3c)
is
supported
by
a
palm-leaf
witness
of
the
HeTa,
but
this
does
not
make
very
good
sense
and
should
also
probably
be
rejected.
The
variants
\emph
{namanārthaṃ}
v.\
\emph
{namanāya}
in
2d
(=
HeTa
2.6.3b)
and
\emph
{japtum}
v.\
\emph
{°jāpāya}
in
3d
(=
HeTa2.6.4b)
are
equivalents,
and
I
see
no
way
of
easily
determining
which
of
these
forms
Advayavajra
originally
wrote.
The
replacement
of
\emph
{śravaṇayoḥ}
with
\emph
{karṇayoḥ}
results
in
a
slight
metrical
improvement,
but
it
must
be
said
that
imposing
stricter
metre
on
these
verses
was
evidently
not
a
priority
for
Advayavajra
here.
Finally
while
the
tantra's
manuscripts
appear
to
point
towards
reading
\emph
{mudrā}
(probably
to
be
understood
as
\emph
{mudrāḥ},
accusaitve
plural),
it
seems
equally
possible
that
Advayavajra
wrote
\emph
{mudrām},
as
the
NaiPra's
ms
indicates.

[374]{mathes2014}[132]{mathes2021},
in
an
effort
to
advance
his
thesis
that
Advayavajra
advocates
a
non-tantric
form
of
Mahāmudrā
practice,
has
written
the
following
about
this
passage:
`...
it
is
not
completely
out
of
the
question
that
an
empowerment
in
Maitrīpa's
system
could
start
directly
with
the
\emph
{prajñājñāna}-empowerment.
In
his
\emph
{Nairātmyāprakāśa},
Maitrīpa
thus
explains
the
ordinary
creation
stage
as
an
optional
practice,
and
not
as
a
necessary
requirement
for
the
subsequent
stages.'
Judging
by
Mathes's
translation,
his
assertion
here
appears
to
rest
on
having
understood
the
word
\emph
{anyatra}
in
the
sense
of
`alternatively'—perhaps
as
an
equivilent
to
\emph
{athavā}.
I
am
unsure
why
we
should
understand
\emph
{anyatra}
here
as
having
a
meaning
other
than
the
expected
`elsewhere'.
The
meaning
`elsewhere'
makes
good
sense
in
the
larger
context
of
the
\emph
{Nairātmyāprakāśa}:
the
\emph
{utpattikrama}
taught
here
in
this
\emph
{sādhana}
consists
in
visualising
the
goddesses;
elsewhere,
a
\emph
{gambhīrotpattikrama}
and
forms
of
\emph
{utpannakrama}
are
also
taught,
and
they
too
are
connected
with
Nairātmyā.
\par
Even
were
we
to
grant
that
Advayavajra
intends
\emph
{anyatra}
to
mean
`alternatively',
this
still
does
not
support
Mathes's
interpretation
that
`the
ordinary
creation
stage'
is
an
optional
practice.
This
would
simply
mean
that
practitioners
can
choose
which
practice
to
do—for
instance,
they
may
practice
\emph
{bāhyotpattikrama}
on
Mondays
and
\emph
{gambhīrotpattikrama}
on
Tuesdays;
but
that
does
not
tell
us
whether
or
not
\emph
{bāhyotpattikrama}
is
a
necessary
prerequisite
for
the
subsequent
stages.
There
may
be
evidence
elsewhere
in
Advayavajra's
corpus
regarding
this
question,
which
is
indeed
a
very
interesting
one,
but
here
the
matter
is
simply
not
addressed.

I

some

There
are
a
few
points
to
consider
regarding
the
reading
in
\TIB
:
\emph
{'bad

First,
the
translation
evidently
takes
this
as
a
complete
sentence.
It
has
perhaps
confused
\emph
{karaṇa}
with
\emph
{kāraṇa}.
It
also
reflects
the
word
\emph
{advaya}
within
the
compound
ending
\emph
{vāhin},
and
it
connects
this
compound
with
the
following
word,
thus
qualifying
\emph
{bodhicitta}.
These
last
two
points
are
valid
possibilities,
and
I
wish
to
accept
the
former.
We
find
a
few
parallels
in
Advayavajra's
corpus
for
the
compound
\emph
{yuganaddhādvayavāhi}:
e.g.,
\emph
{Amanasikārādhāra}
(ed.\
p.\
497),
the
\emph
{Sekatātparyasaṅgraha}
(ed.\
p.\
413),
and
\emph
{Pañcatathāgatamudrāvivaraṇa}
(ed.\
p.\
377).
\par
Whether
\emph
{anābhogayuganaddhavāhi}
should
qualify
\emph
{bodhicitta}
or
\emph
{sākṣātkaraṇa}
is
slightly
more
difficult
to
determine,
but
perhaps
ultimately
there
is
no
great
difference.
\emph
{Bodhicitta},
the
innate
nature
of
mind,
is
\emph
{anābhogayuganaddhādvayavāhin}
in
that
it
supports
(\emph
{vāhin}
in
the
sense
of
`bearing')
the
non-dual
state
of
the
effortless
unity
of
bliss/compassion
and
emptiness;
manifesting
\emph
{bodhicitta}
is
\emph
{anābhogayuganaddhavāhin}
in
that
it
produces/leads
to
(\emph
{vāhin}
in
the
sense
of
\emph
{pra-√sū}
etc.)
the
non-dual
state
that
is
effortless
coalescence.\par

I
have
hesitantly
settled
on
this
conjecture
with
some
inspiration
from
\TIB
:
\emph
{gsang
sngags
tshul
gyi
bstan
bcos
snying/
/bla
ma
dam
pa'i
'bad
pa
las
shes
pa}.
We
might
expect
\emph
{mantranaya}
for
\emph
{gsang
sngags
thsul},
but
that
would
be
metrically
bad;
a
genitive
case
ending
would
also
be
impossible,
but
perhaps
we
could
also
conjecture
the
compound
\emph
{mantrayānaśāstrasāraṃ}.
My
solution
has
the
slight
disadvantage
of
forming
a
\emph
{ra-vipulā}
in
the
\emph
{pāda},
which
is
unexpected
but
not
impossible,
and
we
can't
easily
explain
the
formation
of
the
corrupt
manuscript
reading:
\emph
{cakranayā
śāstrasāraṃ
raṃ}.
Note
that
\TIB
\
has
also
interpreted
\emph
{guroḥ}
as
a
genitive
form
connected
to
\emph
{yatnena},
leading
a
bizarre
meaning:
`Having
understood
the
essence
of
the
\emph
{śāstra}s
of
the
Way
of
Mantra
by
means
of
[my]
Guru's
effort'.
I
interpret
the
text
as
I
have
construed
it
as
follows:
`Having
diligently
understood
from
[my]
guru
the
essence
of
\emph
{śāstra}
in
the
Vehicle
of
Mantra
\ldots
'

I
have
made
this
conjecture
by
modifying
the
transmitted
text
minimally
to
arrive
at
something
(perhaps)
coherent.
\TIB
\
appears
to
be
translated
rather
freely:

We
can
see
evidence
for
\emph
{mastaka}
with

{spyi

The
final
\emph
{pāda},
\emph

not
yield
a
