# Advayavajra's Nairātmyāprakāśa

This is a draft edition Advayavajra's *Nairātmyāprakāśa*.
There is still a certain amount of work to be done, but the text has now reached a readable form.
I have also included a few transcriptions of other *sādhana*s by Advayavajra.

Let me know (best is probably via email) if you have any suggestions for improving the edition, or simply if you find the project helpful.
Enjoy!
